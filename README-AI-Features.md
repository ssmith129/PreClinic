# Symplify AI Features

This project integrates AI-enhanced capabilities:

- AI Inbox Triage (Dashboard): automatic classification, priority, urgency, confidence, action-required flag, response-time.
- Notifications Intelligence (Header): badges summarizing priority levels.
- Appointment Calendar Insights: recommended slots with risk indicators.
- Email AI Insights: toolbar with priority filters and per-item AI badges injected without altering existing markup.

All features are enabled by default and follow existing UI patterns (Bootstrap 5, Tabler Icons). See README-AI-Integration.md for technical details.
